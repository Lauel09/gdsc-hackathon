# How to
Download the live-server using:
```
npm install -g live-server
```
and run it from _this_ folder only by typing live-server.

You will get a menu, then click on home.html, and a web page will run.

Click on start, and the face recognition would work flawlessly, also open inspect panel to see what's happening.
